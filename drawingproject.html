    <h1>Drawing Project</h1>

    <p>
Project Description - The project will be a game application that will allow multiple users to sketch on a drawing board. The goal will be to have the users each draw on a drawing canvas in order to draw an object that is given to them. For example, if 5 players where given a cat to draw, each player would draw a cat and then press submit. Once submitted, the users will then vote on which one looks the best. The userâ€™s drawing with the most votes would win that round and the user with the most rounds won will be the winner of the match. Users will also be given the option to showcase their work for anyone to see on the main page. If there is enough time, I would also like to incorporate Machine Learning as a way giving a score on how closely it resembles the object they are trying to draw. 
</p><p>
Project Design - <br>
The project will integrate Unity for web browsers so users will be able to draw on canvas with the ability to create aesthetic changes easier. <br>The project will also incorporate a SQL database in order to keep account information, account login, and player logistics.<br> *Possibility of TensorFlow.
</p><p>
Use Case - <br>
The user wants to show off his drawing skill to his peers<br>
The user wants to play fun games with his friends<br>
The user wants to practice everyday drawings

    Project Justification
    </p>
    <p> 
Novelty- The project is different because the gameplay itself is unique. Having players collaboratively work together to draw an object may prove to be more difficult than players may have expected. This is because each player may have different ideas of what an object looks like, and by having each player draw 1 line at a time, it will cause players to blend their different ideas together to draw a unique item. For example, the task would be to draw a plant. One player may start drawing a tree, while another player might be thinking of a flower and start drawing that instead. Now you would have a plant-like object that has some characteristics of a tree and a flower.
    
    </p><p>
Complexity - This project would be a good showcase of my abilities because it would show the use of integrating different libraries together to create a project such as Unity. It will also demonstrate persistent data using the showcase feature and also be handling multiple users at the same time. This project would also incorporate the use of a SQL database for user registration and user data.
